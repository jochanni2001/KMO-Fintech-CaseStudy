# INFLUENTIAL BUDGETING APPS IN THE US FINTECH ECOSYSTEM

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company - MINT ALSO KNOW AS INTUIT MINT

* When was the company incorporated? - 2006.  MINT WAS ACQUIRED BY INTUIT IN 2009.

* Who are the founders of the company? - AARON PATZER

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? - The idea came from his personal experience when he needed to handle the budget for one of his startups. But before starting to write the code for it, he asked everybody if they would use this type of service. He went with the philosophy that instead of creating a product and then asking for feedback it is better to validate your idea first and if the results are positive then you should build it according to the opinions received.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? - in November 2009 Mint was acquired by Intuit for $170 million.  At the time, MINT had approximately 1.7 million users.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? - The mobile app was built with the purpose to help people when they need to deal with their spending and saving issues in a simple and efficient way.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) - The app is intended for anyone and everyone.  The founder embraced the following methodology:  Validate your idea.  Create a prototype.  Build the right team.  Raise funding.  For example he would literally approach people with his prototype and ask them if they would use it.  He also asked about their thoughts regarding security.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) - Patzer developed the full alpha version of Mint.com (in Java J2EE and MySQL) (c) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Patzer


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? - Personal Finance and Money Management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? - The U.S. personal finance software market size is projected to reach $343 million by 2026. According to Business insider (c) https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance-management-market "A large opportunity for PFM services lies with younger, digitally native cohorts. Over seventy percent of Gen Zers believe brands should "help them achieve personal goals and aspirations." And improvements to user experience (UX), data-sharing capabilities, and tools designed to refine one's financial health, have helped PFM solutions capture the attention of these younger consumers."

* What are the other major companies in this domain? - Neobanks: Chime, N26, and Revolut are some of the top neobanks offering personal finance tools built directly into their mobile applications and websites.  Digital wealth management space include: Personal Capital, Nutmeg, and Lending Club.  White-label PFM software providers such as Meniga and Strands.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? The impact was very promising until the acquistion by Intuit.  Present day suggests missed opportunites and neglect because TurboTax generates 10-20 times greater revenue than Mint.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? - Revenues basically.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? - According to Fast Company (c) https://www.fastcompany.com/90453586/what-the-hell-happened-to-mint "In its 2019 fiscal year, Intuit’s consumer sector (basically, Mint and TurboTax) generated $2.775 billion in revenue, versus $3.533 billion for its small business and self-employed division, which is dominated by its QuickBooks accounting software.  As software that people pay for—annually—TurboTax follows a business model that Intuit mastered decades ago. By contrast, Patzer says, Mint’s referral fees for sign-ups through the app yielded “lumpy” income .... For now, Mint benefits from a lack of serious competition."


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) Offering tools and Information on Financial Literacy is great, but if spending behavior do not change, the stress that comes with the thoughts about money will alwauys be a challenge for people.  This article by Psychology Today offers some of my beliefs about undeciplined spending https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-science-behind-behavior/201705/what-is-undisciplined-spending.  The 3 main points of the article include:  (1) overspending relative to one’s income, (2) spending without prior planning or budgeting, and (3) paying far more for a product than is reasonable.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
